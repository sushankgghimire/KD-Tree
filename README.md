# KD-Tree

KD-Tree is a powerful data structure that finds its utility in optimizing searches and retrievals in multi-dimensional spaces. In this study, we delve into the realm of KD-Trees by applying them to the analysis of the Iris dataset, which encompasses data points defined by three distinct features. The primary objective is to exploit the KD-Treeâ€™s ability to accelerate searches and nearest neighbor queries within multi-dimensional datasets. By constructing a KD-Tree from the Iris dataset and effectively partitioning the data points, we aim to enhance the efficiency of various spatial operations. This experiment involves creating a KD-Tree to efficiently organize the Iris dataset in a hierarchical manner. Each node within the KD-Tree delineates a specific region in the multi-dimensional space defined by the features. We are particularly interested in how KD-Trees expedite nearest neighbor searches, making them an invaluable asset when dealing with complex data structures. We will finally look at ball trees, that outperform both the brute-force algorithm and the KD trees for building KNN models quickly.
